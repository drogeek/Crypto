Just some implementations I had to do in my lessons, posting them so I can work on them remotly easily

How to use:
This script works only for PGM file format images
genCrypt first applies Hamming code to the image, increasing its size by 2 because of an useless bit (7/8 bits used): result image name "enc_YOUR_ORIGINAL_FILE_NAME"
genErr changes a random bit in every single pixel: result image name "err_YOUR_ORIGINAL_FILE_NAME"
genCorr recover the original image from the corrupted one: result image name "cor_YOUR_ORIGINAL_FILE_NAME"
